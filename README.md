# Data Structures and Algorithms in C and C++

Code from the Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++ course from Udemy.

1. Concepts

    Basic concepts of C/C++.
- Arrays.
- Structs.
- Pointers.
- Reference in C++.
- Structs with pointers.
- Types of parameter passing:
    - Value.
    - Address.
    - Reference (only in C++).
- Passing structs as parameters to functions.
- Returning structs from functions.
- Code style with structs and functions in C.
- OOP in C++:
    - Class definition.
    - Access modifiers:
        - Public.
        - Private.
    - Constructors.
    - Headers and methods.
    - File modularization.
    - Compilation:
        - `g++ Rectangle.h Rectangle.cpp -o Rectangle`
